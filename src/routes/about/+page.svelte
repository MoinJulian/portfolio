<h1>About</h1>

<h2>About my self</h2>

<p>
	Before commencing my studies in England, I attended a school in Germany for nine years, from Year
	1 to Year 9. In the English education system, this corresponds to Years 2 to 10. During the middle
	of my ninth year in Germany, I made the decision to pursue my education in England. Due to my
	inadequate proficiency in English and my will to keep improving my English skills, I chose to
	repeat the year. Following the summer holidays in 2022, I arrived in England in Year 10 to retake
	the school year and enhance my English skills. As the first term concluded around Christmas time,
	I decided to continue my studies in England as I found the experience immensely enjoyable.

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>
	I began my programming journey approximately two years ago, initially focusing on HTML and CSS as
	part of my school curriculum. However, after a few weeks, I developed a keen interest in learning
	JavaScript. My motivation behind this decision was to acquire the ability to create interactive
	websites through coding. This pivotal moment occurred around the middle of 2022. After several
	months of learning JavaScript and writing my first program in JavaScript, I also came across
	Svelte, which is a JavaScript framework that allows component-based programming. Once I delved
	into learning Svelte for a few weeks, I discovered SvelteKit, which is an extension of Svelte and
	serves as a full-stack framework. See <a href="/skills">Skills</a> for a more complete list of my developing
	skills.
