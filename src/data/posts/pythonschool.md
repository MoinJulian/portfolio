The Python School project is the Repositor with all my Python code I have written in school during lessons or for prep it can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/MoinJulian/School-Programming), you will see that this repository has 100% Python, becuase that is the only language used in it, that's why I got nearly 8% Python usage overall.
