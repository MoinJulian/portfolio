Golf is the site with all my golf games, which are "4 winning", which is a four in a row with a few modifications to fit the purpose and function as an training app for golfer, as well as "Exact", which is my seconds game, which objective it is to shoot as exact as possible, to get as much points as possible, and last but not least "Precision", which goal it is to get as less points deducted as possible, you start with 100 points and the game gives you a distance to play, for eah meter you miss that distance, you get one point deducted.
