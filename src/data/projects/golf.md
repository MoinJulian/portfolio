Welcome to "Golf Games" - your ultimate destination for golf fun and
challenges! Discover two captivating golf games: "4Winning" and "Exact",
guaranteed to put your skills to the test and take you on exciting
adventures.

## Games

### 4 Winning

4 Winning is the first exicting game, which goal is to get 4 in a row, you
can connect them vertikal, horizontal and diagonal, as soon a team gets four
in a row, a message will be displayed. The game allways shows the current
team and gives an option to switch the team, you can take the field from
your oponent, so the game is more exciting.

### Exact

Exact is the second game I developed, the goal of the game is to get as many
points with 40 shots, so 20 shots per team, after the 40 shots, the team
with the most points will be displayed. You can see the amount of points per
field at the left hand side of the game board, there's no limit of how often
a field can get hit.

### Precision

Precision is the third game I have developed. The objective of the game is
to get as close to the targets as possible. For every meter you miss the
target, you will receive a deduction of one point. The winner of the game is
the player with the highest points at the end. The game concludes when only
one player has points remaining. You can observe the distance you need to
shoot and the current team, along with the remaining points for each team.
